Hello! My name is Peter. I’m in 10th grade, and I really enjoy listening to K-Pop and rap music. My favorite type of books to read is manga, because the images make the stories engaging and immersive.

One movie I enjoy is Iron Man 1 since it’s dynamic and marks the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A new skill I’ve learned recently is faster soccer dribbling and ball handling. Some personal achievements I’ve accomplished are completing elementary and middle school, reaching my peak in Valorant, and simply being alive. A unique fact about me is that I’m quite fast.

My goals for this upcoming school year are to reach Immortal in Valorant and to earn mostly A’s in my classes. During the summer of 2024, I went on a cruise to places like Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. On these islands, I explored tropical forests, enjoyed river attractions, went swimming, and snorkeled in the clear blue waters. On the cruise, I ate plenty of soft-serve ice cream and burgers. One of the best dishes I had over the summer was ramen, which I like because it’s customizable and flavorful. My favorite kind is spicy ramen with lots of meat — a dish I enjoy for both its taste and its spice.

In computer science class, I hope to learn how to code for games or create models. One of my most memorable experiences this summer was going to the beach with my family, where we ate good food and I had fun swimming in the waves.
