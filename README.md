Hello! My name is Peter, I am in 10th grade and I really like listening to K-Pop and rap music. My favorite kind of books to read is manga. I like reading manga becaise there is images all around and is engaging and emersive. One movie that I enjoy is Iron Man 1, for the movie is dynamic and is the start of the path for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. One new skill that I have learned recently is faster soccer dribbling and ball handling. Some personal achievements I have preformed are completing middle and elementary school, hitting my peak in Valorant, and being alive. One unqiue fact about me is that I am quite fast. Some goals for this upcoming school year is reaching Immortal in Valorant, and having mostly A's for most of my classes. During 2024's summer break, I went on a cruise that sent me to countries like Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. On these islands I explored the tropical forests and river attractions, and went swimming and snorkling in the clear blue waters. Also on the cruise I ate a lot of soft serve ice cream and burgers. One of the best dishes I ate during the summer was ramen becuase it is very customizable where you can add any other products or extras. My favorite flavor for my ramen is a spicy flavor with lots of meat. This dish is special to me because I enjoy the taste and spice that comes from it. Some things that I hope to learn in computer science class is to code for games and or modeling. One memorable experience I had during the summer was going to the beach with my family. We ate good food and I had fun swimming in the waves.
